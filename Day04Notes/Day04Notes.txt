Lect #4	 --- Last Lecture..

	<<< digging deeper >>>

	quick revision... on Associations

	quick revision... on Lambda and Proc

	both are oop realization of block -> Proc doesn't care about the number of argumnets
	but Lambda will.

#1	(todays' agenda)

	Internationalization (i18n)
	Action Mailer.
	Active Job.
	Testing Rails Applications.


 	<<< Internationaliztion >>>

 	there are two methods
 		localize <l> and translate <t> => looks up text translations and returns val according to the local.

 		localize <l> localizes the date and time object to local formats.

 		they're used i18n.t and i18n.l respectively.

 		rails adds all rb. and yml files from the config/locals 


i18n.available -> sets the whitelisted locales.

#2	ApplicationController is parent of all controllers.

before_action :set_locale

def set_locale
	I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale #this will set the locale in a requst.
end

#3	in ApplicationController#default_url_options => simply override this function 
	{ locale: i18n.locale } 

#4	using a scope '(:locale)', locale: /en|nl/ do  #this will create a default locale in url. 
		resources :books
	end
	


#5	get \:locale' => 'dashboard#index' #this will enable the normal root to be active as 	 well.
	
	NOTE THAT WE ADD BOTH ORIGINAL ROOT AND THE NEWLY CREATED ROOT WITH LOCALE SO BOTH
	WORK FINE SIDE BY SIDE.

#6	/config/locales is the folder that has all the locales we have defined by default.






























---------------------------------SECTION 2---------------------------------------------


<<< Action Mailer >>>


#1	it is like a controller.

#2	rails generate mailer UserMailer => studlycase.

#3	you build the application mailer #default class and within it you'll have methods
	and each one will map to a view and each view you can place simple plain html and 
	there is a shared instant variable between methods and corresponding views 
	just like controller actions and their views.

	YOU MUST USE THE _url WITH EMAILS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE FULL PATH AND NOT THE 
	RELATIVE PATH FROM THE LOCALHOST.

	$RAILS_ENV.rb this will show the current path.

#4	configure the smtp client in order to send an email.




























-----------------------------------SECTION 3----------------------------------------

	<<< Active Job Basics >>>

#1	is a framwork for declaring jobs and making them run ona  variety of queuing 			backends. these jobs can be everything from regularity scheduled clean-ups,..etcs

#2	rails generate job guests_cleanup

	it will generate a test and the file we'll use and another file..

#3	within the code, first line will define the queue that this job would run on.

#4	there will be a method that is "perform" and it'll contain the details for the 
	job you're defining.

#5	active job has some adapters for queuing service.
		Sidekiq etc. activeJob: QueueAdapters.

#6	active jobs has callbacks so after or before or around the job etc.

	before_enqueue.
	after_enqueue.
	around_enqueue.
	after_perform.
	before_perform.
	around_perform.

	<<< TESTING RAILS APPLICATIONS >>>

	how to write tests and why ?


#1	"Unit Testing": It is a test of a certain capacity or certain unit of the
	system.

#2	"End to End testing": scenario based testing.

#3	rails test : this will go directly to test dir and will run ever test in this dir.

#4	to run a certain method within a certain file
	rails test dir <complete_method_name>

	for certain dir to run
		rails test dir

#5	test cases start with 'test' "detailed name of test block" do
		
	end


NOTE THAT overcommit is a gem that will stop you from running a commit without running
	your tests making sure you're developing a working code.

	<<< system test >>>

#6	this is a scenario-based testing methodology. (using browser).

	
#7	Screenshot Helper (this would take a screenshot and save it into tmp directory).
